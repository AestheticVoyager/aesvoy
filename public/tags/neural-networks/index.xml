      <description>This series explores DenseNet&amp;rsquo;s revolutionary approach to neural connectivity that solved vanishing gradients and improved feature reuse, examines its mathematical foundations and practical implementation, and discusses how its limitations eventually paved the way for Vision Transformers. We trace the evolution from convolutional networks to hybrid architectures, showing how each innovation built upon previous breakthroughs while addressing their shortcomings in the endless pursuit of more efficient and powerful deep learning models.</description>

      <description>LeNet-5 is an early and very influential type of convolutional neural network (CNN) developed by Yann LeCun and his colleagues in 1998, designed mainly to recognize handwritten digits like those in the MNIST dataset. What makes LeNet-5 special is how it combines several clever ideas that allow it to efficiently and accurately understand images despite their complexity—ideas that were crucial stepping stones for today’s deep learning revolution.</description>
