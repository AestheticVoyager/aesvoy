      <description>LeNet-5 is an early and very influential type of convolutional neural network (CNN) developed by Yann LeCun and his colleagues in 1998, designed mainly to recognize handwritten digits like those in the MNIST dataset. What makes LeNet-5 special is how it combines several clever ideas that allow it to efficiently and accurately understand images despite their complexity—ideas that were crucial stepping stones for today’s deep learning revolution.</description>

      <title>Muon: Second Order Optimizer for Hidden Layers</title>

      <description>Muon is a second-order optimizer for deep learning models, designed to accelerate training and reduce memory usage. It leverages information about the curvature of the loss landscape to achieve faster convergence and more efficient memory utilization. By overcoming historical computational barriers and standardizing its usage, Muon brings the theoretical advantages of second-order optimization to the scale required for LLMs, potentially reshaping both practice and expectations in deep learning.</description>
