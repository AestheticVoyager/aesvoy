# From Convolutional Neural Networks to Vision Transformers: The Evolution of Image Recognition

The landscape of image recognition has undergone a significant transformation with the advent of Vision Transformers (ViTs). Traditionally, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) dominated the field, becoming the go-to architecture for tasks ranging from object detection to image classification. However, the introduction of ViTs has marked a pivotal moment, showcasing the potential of Transformer architectures—originally designed for natural language processing (NLP)—to revolutionize computer vision. This post delves into the mechanics of ViTs, contrasts them with the CNN paradigm, and explores the implications of this shift.

## The Rise of CNNs: A Brief Overview

Before the emergence of Vision Transformers, Convolutional Neural Networks were the cornerstone of image recognition. CNNs excelled in tasks requiring spatial hierarchies, such as recognizing patterns in images. Their architecture is characterized by layers of convolutions that progressively capture local features, from edges in the initial layers to more complex shapes and objects in deeper layers.

The core strength of CNNs lies in their ability to leverage local connectivity and weight sharing. This means that each neuron in a convolutional layer is connected to a small, localized region of the input image, known as a receptive field. This approach makes CNNs particularly effective at detecting spatially close features, allowing them to generalize well across various visual tasks.

However, despite their successes, CNNs have limitations. They struggle to capture long-range dependencies in images, meaning they may miss relationships between distant parts of an image. Additionally, CNNs are inherently biased toward local features, which can be a double-edged sword—while it helps in certain scenarios, it can also limit the network's ability to understand global context in an image.

## Enter Vision Transformers: A New Paradigm

Vision Transformers (ViTs) have introduced a novel approach to image recognition, challenging the dominance of CNNs. Unlike CNNs, which rely on convolutional layers to process images, ViTs leverage the Transformer architecture, which has been immensely successful in NLP tasks. The key innovation of ViTs is their ability to capture global context and long-range dependencies directly, without the need for convolutional operations.

## How ViTs Work: A Deep Dive

1. **Image Splitting**: The first step in a ViT is to split an image into a grid of small, fixed-size patches, akin to how text is divided into tokens in NLP tasks. Each patch is then flattened into a 1D vector and linearly projected into a fixed-size embedding.

2. **Positional Embeddings**: Unlike CNNs, Transformers do not have an inherent understanding of the spatial relationships between elements in their input. To compensate, ViTs add positional embeddings to the patch embeddings, encoding the position of each patch within the original image.

3. **Transformer Encoder**: The core of the ViT model is the Transformer encoder, which consists of multiple layers that include:
   - **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: This mechanism allows each patch to attend to every other patch in the image, enabling the model to capture global context and relationships across the entire image.
   - **Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs)**: Following the attention mechanism, each patch embedding is processed independently through a multi-layer perceptron, enabling the model to extract deeper, non-linear features.
   - **Residual Connections and Layer Normalization**: These components are crucial for the stability and efficient training of the model, ensuring that gradients flow smoothly through the network.

4. **Classification Head**: After the Transformer encoder processes the patch embeddings, a classification head—typically a simple linear layer—is applied to predict the class label of the image.

## Advantages and Limitations of ViTs

Vision Transformers bring several advantages over traditional CNNs:

- **Global Context**: ViTs naturally capture long-range dependencies, which is challenging for CNNs. This capability allows ViTs to understand the global structure of an image more effectively.
- **Scalability**: The modular design of Transformers makes it easier to scale ViTs by increasing model size, training data, or compute resources.
- **State-of-the-Art Performance**: On large datasets, ViTs have outperformed even the most advanced CNN architectures, setting new benchmarks in image recognition tasks.

However, ViTs are not without their challenges:

- **Data Efficiency**: ViTs require large amounts of data to train effectively. Unlike CNNs, which can achieve reasonable performance with relatively small datasets, ViTs tend to underperform on smaller datasets unless augmented with inductive biases similar to those in CNNs (e.g., locality and translation invariance).
- **Computational Demand**: The self-attention mechanism in ViTs, while powerful, is computationally expensive, particularly as the input size increases.

### Scaling ViTs: The Path to Dominance

One of the most intriguing aspects of Vision Transformers is their scalability. Research has shown that scaling ViTs in terms of compute, training data size, and model size leads to predictable performance improvements, often following power laws. Larger models require fewer samples to achieve the same level of performance, making them increasingly efficient as more compute is available.

This scalability is exemplified by the performance of ViTs on large datasets like JFT-300M, where they have surpassed the best CNNs. By learning both local and global representations, ViTs have demonstrated their capacity to handle complex visual tasks that require understanding both fine-grained details and broader context.

## What are the main computational bottlenecks when training Vision Transformers for medical imaging

The main computational bottlenecks when training Vision Transformers (ViTs) for medical imaging include the following:

### 1. **Quadratic Complexity in Attention Mechanism**

ViTs utilize a self-attention mechanism that computes relationships between all pairs of input tokens (patches). This results in a computational complexity of $$O(N^2 \cdot D)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of patches and $$D$$ is the dimensionality of the embeddings. As the number of patches increases (due to higher resolution images), this quadratic scaling can lead to significant computational overhead, making training slower and more resource-intensive.

### 2. **Memory Usage**

The memory requirements for storing the intermediate activations during training can be substantial. The attention mechanism requires storing matrices for each layer, which can consume a large amount of GPU memory, especially for high-resolution medical images. This can limit the batch size and the overall capacity of the model that can be trained on available hardware.

### 3. **Large Model Sizes**

ViTs tend to have a larger number of parameters compared to traditional CNNs, especially when scaled for performance. Training these larger models requires more computational resources and longer training times. The increased model size can also lead to challenges in convergence and optimization.

### 4. **Data Requirements for Effective Training**

ViTs generally require large amounts of labeled data to achieve optimal performance. In medical imaging, datasets are often smaller and more limited, which can lead to overfitting. The need for extensive pre-training on large datasets can be a bottleneck if such data is not available or if the computational resources for pre-training are insufficient.

### 5. **Training Time**

Due to the above factors, the overall training time for ViTs can be significantly longer compared to CNNs. This is particularly relevant in medical imaging, where rapid iteration and experimentation are often necessary for model development.

These computational bottlenecks highlight the challenges associated with training Vision Transformers for medical imaging tasks. Addressing these issues often requires specialized hardware, efficient training strategies, and potentially novel architectural modifications to optimize performance and reduce resource consumption.

## Medical Image datasets where ViTs outperform CNNs

There are a few notable medical imaging datasets where Vision Transformers (ViTs) have been shown to outperform Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):

### CheXpert

CheXpert is a large dataset of chest X-rays with 14 different thoracic diseases. Studies have found that ViTs pretrained on large datasets like JFT-300M can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the CheXpert benchmark, surpassing strong CNN baselines.

### CAMELYON16/17

These datasets consist of whole-slide images of lymph node sections for the task of metastatic breast cancer detection. When pretrained on large datasets, ViTs have demonstrated superior performance compared to CNNs on these challenging histopathology tasks.

### ISIC 2019

The International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) 2019 dataset contains dermoscopic images for skin lesion classification. ViTs pretrained on JFT-300M have achieved top results on the ISIC 2019 benchmark, outperforming previous CNN-based methods.

The key factor enabling ViTs to outperform CNNs on these medical imaging datasets is the availability of large-scale pretraining data. When pretrained on extensive datasets like JFT-300M, ViTs can learn robust representations that transfer effectively to specific medical tasks, even outperforming strong CNN baselines.

However, in lower-data regimes, the strong inductive biases of CNNs for locality and translation invariance can still be advantageous. The choice between ViTs and CNNs depends on the specific dataset size and task requirements.

## How do ViTs and CNNs differ in their ability to handle noisy medical data

Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) differ in their ability to handle noisy medical data in a few key ways:

### Robustness to Noise

- CNNs, due to their local connectivity and translation invariance, are generally more robust to certain types of noise and artifacts in medical images, such as sensor noise or small occlusions.
- ViTs, on the other hand, rely more on global attention mechanisms. While this allows them to capture long-range dependencies, it can also make them more sensitive to noise that affects the global structure of the image.

### Generalization from Limited Data

- When trained on limited data, CNNs may generalize better to noisy test examples compared to ViTs. The strong inductive biases of CNNs for locality and translation invariance can help them learn more robust features from smaller datasets.
- ViTs, however, can outperform CNNs in the presence of large amounts of training data, as they are able to learn more comprehensive representations that are still effective in the presence of noise.

### Attention Mechanisms

- The attention mechanism in ViTs allows them to focus on informative regions of the image. However, in the presence of noise, the attention can sometimes get distracted by irrelevant features.
- Techniques like robust attention, which down-weights uninformative patches, may help ViTs handle noisy data more effectively.

### Architectural Modifications

- Incorporating inductive biases from CNNs into ViT architectures, such as convolutional layers or local attention, can improve their robustness to noise while still leveraging their ability to capture long-range dependencies.

In summary, while CNNs may have an advantage in handling noisy medical data due to their strong inductive biases, ViTs can potentially match or exceed their performance with sufficient training data and architectural modifications. The choice between the two ultimately depends on the specific characteristics of the medical imaging task and dataset.

ViTs can capture long-range dependencies across the entire image. This global context understanding helps the model differentiate between noise and significant features that may be spatially distant from each other. For instance, in medical imaging, important anatomical structures may be far apart, and the ability to consider the entire image can aid in accurate interpretation despite the presence of noise.

### 3. **Multi-Head Attention**

The multi-head attention mechanism allows ViTs to learn multiple representations of the input data simultaneously. Each attention head can focus on different aspects of the image, which can be beneficial for identifying and mitigating the effects of noise. By aggregating information from various heads, the model can form a more comprehensive understanding of the image, enhancing its ability to handle noisy data.

### 4. **Robustness through Aggregation**

The attention mechanism aggregates information from all patches, allowing ViTs to build a more stable representation of the input. This aggregation can help smooth out the effects of noise, as the model can rely on the collective information from multiple patches rather than being overly influenced by any single noisy patch.

### 5. **Adaptability to Noise Patterns**

ViTs can learn to adapt to specific noise patterns present in medical imaging data through training. By incorporating diverse training samples that include various types of noise, ViTs can develop a better understanding of how to handle such noise during inference.

Overall, the attention mechanisms in Vision Transformers provide them with unique advantages in handling noisy medical data. Their ability to selectively focus on relevant features, understand global context, and aggregate information from multiple perspectives allows ViTs to maintain performance even in the presence of noise, making them a valuable tool in medical imaging applications.

Combining ViTs with CNNs can leverage the strengths of both architectures. For example, using CNN layers for initial feature extraction followed by ViT layers for capturing global dependencies can improve performance, especially in scenarios with limited data.

### 4. **Attention Mechanism Optimization**

Refining the attention mechanisms within ViTs can enhance their ability to focus on relevant features while ignoring noise. Techniques such as robust attention, which down-weights uninformative patches, can improve the model's performance in noisy medical imaging environments.

### 5. **Incorporating Domain Knowledge**

Integrating domain-specific knowledge into the model architecture can improve performance. This can include using anatomical priors or incorporating expert annotations to guide the attention mechanisms, helping the model focus on clinically relevant features.

### 6. **Fine-Tuning Hyperparameters**

Carefully tuning hyperparameters such as learning rates, batch sizes, and the number of attention heads can lead to better convergence and performance. Experimenting with different configurations can help identify the optimal setup for medical imaging tasks.

### 7. **Regularization Techniques**

Applying regularization techniques such as dropout, weight decay, and early stopping can prevent overfitting, especially when working with smaller medical datasets. These techniques help maintain generalization capabilities.

### 8. **Multi-Modal Learning**

Incorporating additional data modalities (e.g., clinical data, genomic information) alongside imaging data can enhance the model's understanding and improve predictive performance. Multi-modal learning can provide a more comprehensive view of the patient's condition.

### 9. **Efficient Training Strategies**

Implementing efficient training strategies, such as mixed precision training and distributed training, can reduce computational overhead and speed up the training process, making it more feasible to train larger ViT models on medical imaging tasks.

By employing these optimization strategies, Vision Transformers can be better adapted for medical imaging applications, leading to improved accuracy, robustness, and overall performance in clinical settings. Continued research and experimentation will further refine these approaches and enhance the utility of ViTs in medical imaging.
