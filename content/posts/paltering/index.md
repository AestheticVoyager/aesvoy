# Paltering: The Subtle Art of Misleading with the Truth

Facts, on their own, tell us nothing. It's the context in which these facts are presented that gives them meaning and allows us to construct narratives. In philosophical terms, fact-checking is a necessary condition for telling a true story, but it's not sufficient. This idea is crucial when we delve into the concept of paltering.

[**Paltering**](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/todd_rogers/files/paltering.pdf) is the act of misleading by telling the truth. Unlike lying, where false information is provided, paltering involves selecting truthful statements that lead someone to a false or misleading conclusion. It's a subtle and sophisticated form of deception, often used to manipulate without directly falsifying information.

## Context and Facts

Let's consider how context affects facts. When you present facts within a particular framework, you shape the story they tell. For example, stating that "crime rates have dropped by 20%" might seem positive. However, if the overall crime rate was very high to begin with, a 20% drop may still indicate a serious problem. Thus, the context in which we place facts transforms them into a narrative.

In philosophical terms, this is akin to the principle that fact-checking alone doesn't ensure truthfulness. You need the right context and interpretation to form a true story. This concept is deeply rooted in the works of philosophers like David Hume, particularly his ideas about the is-ought problem.

## Hume's Guillotine and the Is-Ought Problem

[David Hume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume), an 18th-century Scottish philosopher, introduced the [is-ought problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem), also known as Hume's Guillotine. He argued that you cannot derive an "ought" from an "is." In other words, you can't infer what should be done based on what is, without introducing some additional assumptions.

For instance, just because science tells us how the world is, it doesn't inherently tell us what we should do about it. Science describes phenomena, but it doesn't prescribe actions. This gap between descriptive statements (what is) and prescriptive statements (what ought to be) is critical. It underscores the need for assumptions, values, or goals to bridge the two.

## The Role of Scientific Method

But what if we tried to replace these assumptions with the scientific method? What if we used empirical data and experiments to determine what works? Surely, we can trust science to guide our actions, right?

The answer is nuanced. While the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) is a powerful tool for understanding the world, it is not infallible. It relies on rigorous testing, peer review, and reproducibility to validate findings. However, even with these mechanisms in place, science itself doesn't dictate what we should do with the knowledge it provides. It can inform decisions, but it cannot make value judgments.

For instance, scientific research might show that a particular policy reduces pollution. However, whether society prioritizes this reduction over economic growth is a value judgment, not a scientific one. This is where the assumptions and goals we introduce play a crucial role.

## Trusting Science with a Critical Eye

So, can we trust science? Yes, as long as we remain critical and aware of its limitations. Science can guide us toward effective solutions, but we must be cautious about assuming it has all the answers or that it can make ethical decisions for us. Scientific findings should inform our choices, but they must be interpreted and applied within a broader context that includes ethical, social, and practical considerations.

## In conclusion

In conclusion, paltering reminds us that even truthful statements can be used to mislead. Understanding the context and limitations of facts, and the role of scientific method in informing but not dictating actions, is essential. This awareness helps us navigate the complex interplay between truth, context, and the stories we construct from them.
